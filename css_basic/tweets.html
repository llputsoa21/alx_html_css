    <p>My tech journey began 20 years ago. I landed a job as
        the first community manager at Autocode.
        The engineering team was building the Node.js API platform and editor to power different business needs.</p>
    </article>
    <p>Node? Javascript? APIs? It was all very foreign to me then.
        But, it was exactly what I was looking for — a challenging and exciting opportunity to learn about business
        development, marketing, finance, and more so that I could successfully launch my family’s business one day.
        I learned everything I wanted and more.</p>

    <h2>From community manager to developer advocate at Autocode</h2>
    </aside>
    <p>I loved my role as the Community Manager at Autocode.
        I enjoyed building relationships with ambitious and inspiring makers and software engineers from all over
        the world who were using Autocode to leverage APIs for their business needs. I connected with amazing makers
        and creative technologists like Matthew Lal, who helped me cofound Maker.Dev — a community that brings
        developers and makers together to share and learn from one another.</p>

    <p>We mastered terminal commands, Git, and Github and learned HTML/CSS/JS in the first three weeks.
        In the fourth week, we built our first project — a game!
        I chose to recreate one of my childhood favorites — Tetris.
        I am very excited to release a step-by-step tutorial in the upcoming weeks.</p>
